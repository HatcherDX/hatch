## Coding Standards

Hatcher follows strict coding standards to ensure consistency, maintainability, and high-quality code across the entire project.

**ðŸ“‹ [Complete Coding Standards Guide](./coding-standards.md)**

### Quick Reference

**TypeScript**

- Use TypeScript for all new code with strict mode enabled
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables and functions
- Include JSDoc comments for all public APIs

**Vue.js**

- Use Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax
- Define props and emits with TypeScript interfaces
- Prefer composables for reusable logic
- Follow single-file component structure: script â†’ template â†’ style

**Styling**

- Use scoped styles for component-specific CSS
- Follow BEM methodology for class naming
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Prefer flexbox and CSS Grid for layouts

**Git Conventions**

- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) format
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`
- Keep commits atomic and focused on a single change

### Code Quality Tools

We use automated tools to enforce standards:

```bash
# Lint and fix code style issues
pnpm lint:fix

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Format code
pnpm format
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Husky runs automatic checks before each commit:

- ESLint for code quality
- TypeScript compilation
- Prettier for formatting
- Unit tests for critical paths

For detailed guidelines, examples, and best practices, see our [Coding Standards](./coding-standards.md) documentation.
