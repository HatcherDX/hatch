### Code Contributions

#### Before You Start

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Look for related issues or feature requests
2. **Discuss Major Changes**: Open an issue to discuss significant changes
3. **Start Small**: Begin with small, focused contributions

#### Development Workflow

1. **Create a Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes**
   - Follow our coding standards (see below)
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test Your Changes**

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   pnpm test
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**

   ```

   We follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) format.

5. **Push and Create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Coding Standards

Hatcher follows strict coding standards to ensure consistency, maintainability, and high-quality code across the entire project.

**📋 [Complete Coding Standards Guide](./coding-standards.md)**

### Quick Reference

**TypeScript**

- Use TypeScript for all new code with strict mode enabled
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables and functions
- Include JSDoc comments for all public APIs

**Vue.js**

- Use Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax
- Define props and emits with TypeScript interfaces
- Prefer composables for reusable logic
- Follow single-file component structure: script → template → style

**Styling**

- Use scoped styles for component-specific CSS
- Follow BEM methodology for class naming
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Prefer flexbox and CSS Grid for layouts

**Git Conventions**

- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) format
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`
- Keep commits atomic and focused on a single change

### Code Quality Tools

We use automated tools to enforce standards:

```bash
# Lint and fix code style issues
pnpm lint:fix

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Format code
pnpm format
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Husky runs automatic checks before each commit:

- ESLint for code quality
- TypeScript compilation
- Prettier for formatting
- Unit tests for critical paths

For detailed guidelines, examples, and best practices, see our [Coding Standards](./coding-standards.md) documentation.
