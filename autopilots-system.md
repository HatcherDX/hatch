# The Autopilot System

The Autopilot system is Hatcher's tactical automation framework that transforms complex development workflows into intelligent, executable recipes. Where Playbooks define the strategy (standards and patterns), Autopilots are the tactics that automate the implementation of those patterns with AI-powered intelligence.

## What Are Autopilots?

Autopilots are structured workflows that combine:

- **Task Automation**: Multi-step processes executed with precision
- **AI Intelligence**: Context-aware decisions during execution
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless interaction with development tools
- **Error Handling**: Intelligent recovery from common issues

They are the "recipes" that know HOW to achieve what your Playbooks declare you WANT to achieve.

## Autopilot Structure

A basic Autopilot follows this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Create Vue Component",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Generate a complete Vue 3 component with tests",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "name": "componentName",
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Name of the component in PascalCase",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "name": "useTypeScript",
      "type": "boolean",
      "description": "Use TypeScript",
      "default": true
    }
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "create-component",
      "action": "file.create",
      "path": "src/components/${componentName}.vue"
    },
    {
      "name": "create-test",
      "action": "file.create",
      "path": "tests/${componentName}.spec.ts"
    },
    {
      "name": "validate-quality",
      "action": "run.action",
      "name": "test:component"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Built-in Autopilots

Hatcher ships with powerful Autopilots for common development patterns:

### Component Autopilots

- **Create Component**: Generate complete components with tests
- **Extract Component**: Refactor code into reusable components
- **Update Props**: Modify component interfaces safely

### Refactoring Autopilots

- **Extract Function**: Pull logic into utility functions
- **Rename Symbol**: Safely rename across entire codebase
- **Move Module**: Relocate code with import updates

### Testing Autopilots

- **Generate Tests**: Create test suites from implementation
- **Update Snapshots**: Refresh test snapshots intelligently
- **Coverage Report**: Analyze and improve test coverage

### Documentation Autopilots

- **Generate JSDoc**: Add documentation from code analysis
- **Update README**: Keep documentation synchronized
- **API Documentation**: Generate API docs from code

## Creating Custom Autopilots

### Basic Workflow Autopilots

Create Autopilots for your team's specific workflows:

```yaml
name: Setup New Feature
description: Initialize a new feature with all required structure
inputs:
  - name: featureName
    type: string
    required: true
  - name: includeTests
    type: boolean
    default: true

steps:
  - name: Create feature directory
    action: directory.create
    path: src/features/${featureName}

  - name: Generate index file
    action: file.create
    path: src/features/${featureName}/index.ts
    template: feature-index

  - name: Create component structure
    action: run.autopilot
    name: Create Vue Component
    inputs:
      componentName: ${featureName}View

  - name: Setup routing
    action: file.modify
    path: src/router/index.ts
    operation: add-route
    route:
      path: /${featureName}
      component: ${featureName}View

  - name: Validate with Actions
    action: run.actions
    actions: ["test:unit", "lint:check", "types:validate"]
```

### AI-Enhanced Autopilots

Leverage AI for intelligent task execution:

```yaml
name: Optimize Component Performance
description: Analyze and optimize Vue component performance
ai-mode: enhanced

steps:
  - name: Analyze component
    action: ai.analyze
    prompt: |
      Analyze this Vue component for performance issues:
      - Unnecessary re-renders
      - Missing memoization
      - Inefficient computed properties
      - Large bundle size

  - name: Apply optimizations
    action: ai.refactor
    playbooks:
      - vue-performance
      - bundle-optimization
    constraints:
      - Maintain all existing functionality
      - Keep TypeScript types intact
      - Preserve component API

  - name: Verify changes
    action: run.actions
    actions: ['test:component', 'performance:benchmark']
```

## Autopilot Triggers

### Manual Execution

Run Autopilots on demand:

```bash
hatcher run create-component --name UserProfile
```

### File Watch Triggers

Execute Autopilots on file changes:

```json
{
  "triggers": [
    {
      "type": "file-change",
      "pattern": "**/*.vue",
      "autopilot": "update-component-docs"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Git Hook Integration

Automate Autopilots with Git workflows:

```json
{
  "triggers": [
    {
      "type": "pre-commit",
      "autopilot": "format-and-lint"
    },
    {
      "type": "post-merge",
      "autopilot": "update-dependencies"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Autopilot Composition

### Sequential Autopilots

Chain Autopilots for complex workflows:

```yaml
name: Complete Feature Development
steps:
  - action: run.autopilot
    name: Create Component

  - action: run.autopilot
    name: Generate Tests

  - action: run.autopilot
    name: Update Documentation

  - action: git.commit
    message: 'feat: Add ${featureName} component'

  - action: run.actions
    name: Final Quality Gates
    actions: ['coverage:verify', 'bundle:size']
```

### Parallel Autopilots

Execute independent tasks simultaneously:

```yaml
name: Project Setup
parallel: true
steps:
  - action: npm.install
  - action: generate.types
  - action: setup.environment
```

### Conditional Autopilots

Add logic to your workflows:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Check TypeScript
    action: config.check
    key: useTypeScript

  - name: Generate types
    condition: ${steps.checkTypeScript.result}
    action: typescript.generate
```

## Error Handling

### Retry Logic

Handle transient failures gracefully:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: API Setup
    action: api.initialize
    retry:
      attempts: 3
      delay: 1000
      backoff: exponential
```

### Fallback Autopilots

Provide alternative paths:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Use npm
    action: npm.install
    fallback:
      - action: yarn.install
      - action: pnpm.install
```

### Error Recovery

Clean up on failure:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Database migration
    action: db.migrate
    onError:
      - action: db.rollback
      - action: notify.team
        message: Migration failed
```

  "autopilots": {
    "directory": "./autopilots",
    "autoload": ["setup", "deploy"],
    "aliases": {
      "dev": "start-development",
      "ship": "deploy-production"
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Autopilot Design

- **Single Responsibility**: Each Autopilot should orchestrate one workflow well
- **Idempotent**: Autopilots should be safe to run multiple times
- **Composable**: Design Autopilots to work together
- **Documented**: Clear descriptions and examples

### Performance

- **Cache Results**: Avoid redundant operations
- **Parallel Execution**: Use parallelism where possible
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity as needed

### Security

- **Input Validation**: Verify all inputs before execution
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Run untrusted Autopilots safely
- **Audit Logging**: Track all Autopilot executions

## Integration with Playbooks and Actions

Autopilots orchestrate between Playbooks (strategy) and Actions (validation):

```yaml
name: Implement Feature
playbooks:
  - vue3-typescript # The standards to follow
  - team-standards # The patterns to use

steps:
  - name: Generate component
    action: ai.create
    prompt: Create a Vue component following our standards

  - name: Apply team patterns
    action: playbook.apply
    strict: true

  - name: Validate with Actions
    action: run.actions
    actions:
      - test:unit # Verify tests pass
      - lint:check # Verify code quality
      - coverage:verify # Verify test coverage
```
