# The Time Graph

## Development's Fourth Dimension

Traditional version control gives you snapshots. The Time Graph gives you a **living timeline** — where every decision, every change, and every possibility exists simultaneously in an explorable, multi-dimensional space.

### The Problem with Linear History

Git and other VCS tools show you a flat, linear progression:

- Commits are just diffs
- Context is lost in commit messages
- Decisions aren't tracked
- Alternatives vanish
- Debugging means archaeology

The Time Graph transforms this into something **fundamentally more powerful**.

## The Multi-Dimensional Codebase

### Beyond Branches

Traditional:

```
main ──●──●──●──●──● (now)
```

Time Graph:

```
         ┌─ Attempt 1 ─── Failed ────┐
         │                           │
main ────┼─ Attempt 2 ─── Success ───┼─── Merged ─── Future
         │                           │
         └─ Attempt 3 ─── Partial ───┘
              │
              └── Each attempt contains:
                  - Full context
                  - Decision rationale
                  - Performance metrics
                  - Team discussions
                  - Alternative approaches
```

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Decision Nodes

Every architectural decision becomes a permanent, queryable node:

```yaml
node: '2024-01-15-14:30:00'
type: 'architectural-decision'
title: 'Switch from REST to GraphQL'
context:
  problem: 'N+1 queries killing mobile performance'
  constraints:
    - 'Must maintain backward compatibility'
    - 'Cannot increase backend complexity'
  options-considered:
    - REST-optimization: 'Rejected: Too complex'
    - GraphQL: 'Accepted: Solves N+1, good tooling'
    - gRPC: 'Rejected: Client compatibility issues'
participants: ['alice', 'bob', 'charlie']
outcome: 'Implemented GraphQL gateway'
metrics:
  before: 'Avg response: 2.3s'
  after: 'Avg response: 0.4s'
```

### 2. Causal Chains

Track cause and effect across time:

```
User Report: "App crashes on login"
    ↓
Time Graph traces backward...
    ↓
3 hours ago: "Login API response format changed"
    ↓
6 hours ago: "Backend validation updated"
    ↓
2 days ago: "Security patch applied"
    ← ROOT CAUSE FOUND
```

### 3. Parallel Timelines

Explore "what if" scenarios without disruption:

```yaml
timeline-alpha:
  approach: 'Microservices'
  status: 'Testing in staging'
  metrics: 'Good isolation, high complexity'

timeline-beta:
  approach: 'Modular monolith'
  status: 'Testing in staging'
  metrics: 'Simple deployment, harder to scale'

decision-point: '2024-02-01'
chosen: 'timeline-beta'
reason: 'Complexity not justified for our scale'
```

### 4. Knowledge Preservation

Never lose context again:

- **Why** did we deprecate that API?
- **Who** decided on this architecture?
- **What** alternatives did we consider?
- **When** did performance degrade?
- **How** did we solve this before?

## Practical Applications

### Debugging Across Time

```bash
# Find when the bug was introduced
hatcher time-graph bisect --bad HEAD --good v1.0.0 --test "npm test"

# See what changed in the critical period
hatcher time-graph diff --from "last-working" --to "first-broken"

# Replay the exact state at crash time
hatcher time-graph replay --timestamp "2024-01-15T14:30:00" --with-state
```

### Architecture Evolution

Track how your system evolved:

```yaml
query: 'Show database evolution'
result:
  2021: 'SQLite - MVP phase'
  2022: 'PostgreSQL - Scaling up'
  2023: 'PostgreSQL + Redis - Caching layer'
  2024: 'PostgreSQL + Redis + Elasticsearch - Search features'

Each transition includes:
  - Migration strategies
  - Rollback plans
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Lessons learned
```

### Team Knowledge

The Time Graph captures human intelligence:

```yaml
query: 'Who knows about payment integration?'
result:
  experts:
    - alice: 'Implemented Stripe integration'
    - bob: 'Debugged webhook issues'
  decisions:
    - 'Chose Stripe over PayPal (2023-03-15)'
    - 'Added idempotency keys (2023-06-20)'
  problems-solved:
    - 'Double charging bug (2023-07-10)'
    - 'Webhook replay issue (2023-09-05)'
```

## Integration with HATs

The Time Graph powers every HAT:

- **Code HAT**: Shows code evolution patterns
- **Gen HAT**: Tracks generation history
- **Visual HAT**: Visual regression timeline
- **Time Graph HAT**: Direct timeline manipulation

## The Philosophical Shift

### From State to History

Traditional development thinks in **states**:

- Current code
- Current bugs
- Current features

Time Graph thinking embraces **history**:

- How we got here
- Why we made choices
- What we learned
- Where we're going

### From Individual to Collective

The Time Graph transforms individual knowledge into collective intelligence:

- Decisions are documented automatically
- Context is preserved forever
- Patterns emerge from history
- Mistakes become lessons

## The Future of Development

With the Time Graph, we can:

### Learn from Patterns

```yaml
pattern-detected: 'Performance degrades after deploys'
analysis:
  - 'Cache not warming properly'
  - 'Happens every 3rd deploy on average'
  - 'Solution applied 5 times before'
recommendation: 'Implement cache warmup in CD pipeline'
```

### Predict Problems

```yaml
prediction: 'Database will hit connection limit'
based-on:
  - 'Current growth rate: 10% weekly'
  - 'Historical pattern: Issues at 80% capacity'
  - 'Time to limit: ~3 weeks'
action: 'Scale connection pool now'
```

### Optimize Decisions

```yaml
similar-decision: 'Choosing message queue'
previous-instances:
  - 2023: 'Chose RabbitMQ - worked well'
  - 2022: 'Chose Kafka - over-engineered'
  - 2021: 'Chose Redis Pub/Sub - outgrew it'
recommendation: 'RabbitMQ fits your scale'
```

## The Temporal Revolution

The Time Graph isn't just a feature — it's a **fundamental shift** in how we think about code:

- Code isn't just what it is, but **how it became**
- Bugs aren't mysteries, but **traceable effects**
- Decisions aren't lost, but **permanently accessible**
- Knowledge isn't siloed, but **collectively shared**

Your codebase has a rich history. The Time Graph makes it **navigable, queryable, and learnable**.
