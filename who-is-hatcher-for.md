# A Command Deck for Every Mission

Whether you're a scrappy startup racing to market, an enterprise modernizing decades of legacy code, or an open source maintainer drowning in pull requests — Hatcher gives you the command deck to orchestrate autonomous development at scale.

## For Startups & Scaleups

### **Move at the Speed of Thought**

Your runway is finite. Your competition doesn't sleep. Every hour your engineers spend on boilerplate, testing, or refactoring is an hour not spent on your differentiator.

With Hatcher Autopilots, your small team operates like it's 10x larger:

- **The Coverage Autopilot** ensures 100% test coverage while you sleep
- **The Refactor Autopilot** modernizes technical debt without breaking features
- **The Documentation Autopilot** keeps your API docs in sync automatically
- **The Migration Autopilot** handles framework upgrades with zero downtime

### **Innovation Without Infrastructure Overhead**

Stop trading innovation for maintenance. Let Autopilots handle the 80% of predictable work so your team can focus on the 20% that defines your company.

**Real Impact:**

- Ship features 3x faster by automating test generation
- Reduce onboarding time by 70% with self-documenting code
- Scale from MVP to Series B without rewriting your stack

## For Enterprise

### **Modernization Without Revolution**

Your legacy systems power critical infrastructure. You can't afford to "move fast and break things." You need evolution, not revolution.

The **Universal Fabricator** transforms legacy code into modern architectures — gradually, safely, and with complete auditability:

- **Pattern-Based Transformation**: Define your target architecture once, apply it across millions of lines
- **Constitutional Constraints**: Every change respects your governance rules
- **Time Graph Auditability**: Every decision traceable, every change reversible
- **Zero-Downtime Migration**: Transform in production with rollback ready

### **Governance at the Speed of Development**

Stop choosing between velocity and compliance. Hatcher's Constitutional Engineering ensures every line of code — whether written by human or Autopilot — follows your policies:

**Built-In Compliance:**

- GDPR/CCPA data handling patterns
- SOC2 audit trails via Time Graph
- Role-based access controls for Playbooks
- Encrypted credential management

### **From Technical Debt to Technical Assets**

That 20-year-old COBOL system? The sprawling Java monolith? The undocumented Python scripts holding everything together?

They're not liabilities — they're **encoded business logic** waiting to be transformed.

## For Open Source

### **Quality at Scale**

Your project has thousands of stars, hundreds of contributors, and a maintainer team of... three?

Hatcher Autopilots become your tireless co-maintainers:

- **PR Review Autopilot**: First-pass review of every contribution
- **Test Coverage Autopilot**: Ensures new features don't break existing ones
- **Documentation Autopilot**: Keeps examples in sync with code
- **Issue Triage Autopilot**: Labels, assigns, and responds to issues

### **Transparency Through Time**

The Time Graph isn't just for debugging — it's a **living history** of your project:

- Show contributors exactly how decisions were made
- Let newcomers explore the codebase evolution
- Prove your security practices with immutable audit logs
- Turn your development process into educational content

### **Sustainable Maintenance**

Stop burning out your maintainers. Let Autopilots handle the repetitive work:

**Automated Maintenance:**

- Dependency updates with compatibility testing
- Security patches with regression verification
- Cross-platform testing without manual setup
- Release notes generated from commit history

### **Community Empowerment**

Turn casual contributors into power users:

- **Playbook Sharing**: Let experienced contributors encode their knowledge
- **Guided Contributions**: Autopilots help newcomers follow project standards
- **Async Collaboration**: Time Graph enables truly asynchronous development

## The Command Deck Awaits

No matter your mission — disruption, transformation, or cultivation — Hatcher gives you the tools to **command** rather than **code**.

**Your copilot era is over. Your commander era begins now.**
