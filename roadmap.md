# Hatcher Roadmap

This document outlines our strategic priorities for bringing the **Hatcher IDE** to market. Its mission is to evangelize our vision, build a dedicated following, and establish Hatcher as the definitive thought leader in the AI development era..

## âœ… Phase 0: The Foundation (Completed)

**Objective:** Build and validate the "luxury scaffolding"â€”the enterprise-grade architectural pillars required to support our ambitious vision.

**Key Results:**

- **Status**: Completed. We shipped a world-class foundation including our custom Git Engine, a Secure Storage Engine (with AES-256 vault), and a GPU-accelerated Professional Terminal.
- **Key Outcome**: Achieved ~90% test coverage and a robust, multi-platform CI/CD pipeline. This proves our commitment to the engineering excellence required for a mission-critical tool.

## ðŸŸ¡ Phase 1: Validating the Core Value (In Progress)

**Objective:** Validate our core "Controlled Amplification" philosophy by delivering a focused and impressive experience within the **Gen HAT**.

**Strategic Focus:** Our entire team is dedicated to perfecting a single, "magical" workflow: `Prompt -> Constitutional Validation -> Time Graph Review -> Commit`.

**Strategic Note:** The successful completion of Phase 1 will culminate in our application to Y Combinator. Our goal is to present a validated MVP, a strong design partner testimonial, and a clear vision for market leadership.

**Key Results:**

- `[In Progress]` **End-to-End Generative Workflow**: Connect the UI to a powerful cloud-based AI engine and ensure the AI output is correctly parsed and displayed in the editor.

- `[To Do]` **The Immutable Diff Panel:** The **Time Graph** must provide a clear, deterministic review process for all AI-generated code. This is the non-negotiable heart of our promise of governance.

- `[To Do]` **A Focused Experience:** Aggressively hide or disable all other incomplete modes and features. The goal is to present a stable and awe-inspiring experience centered exclusively on the core generative loop.

## <DocIcon type="rocket" inline /> Phase 2: Igniting the Flywheel (Next)

**Objective:** Launch the free tier of the **Hatcher IDE**, focused on the **Gen HAT** experience, to the public, initiating our Product-Led Growth (PLG) and community flywheel.

**Strategic Focus:** Drive mass adoption, gather critical user feedback, and cultivate our initial cohort of community champions.

**Key Results:**

- **Launch:** Release a polished, publicly available version of the **Hatcher IDE**, with the **Gen HAT** as the core experience, for free, local use.

- **Activation:** Achieve a strong activation rate, measured by the percentage of users who successfully execute their first AI-powered code generation and review it in the **Time Graph**.

- **Community:** Foster the creation and sharing of the first public **Playbooks**, the flight plans that power our **Autopilots**.

## ðŸ’° Phase 3: Monetization & The EGG Platform (v1.0.0 and Beyond)

**Objective:** Launch our commercial tiers and execute on our full platform strategy by offering two distinct EGG configurations to solve specific enterprise challenges.

**Track 1: Core Product Evolution (Free Tier)**

- **Mission:** Continue to build the most powerful free, local-use IDE for AI-powered development.

- **Roadmap:**
  - **Local LLM Support:** Integrate with local models via Ollama to fulfill our promise of AI Sovereignty.
  - **Expanded Playbook Library:** Grow the public marketplace of **Playbooks**, enhancing the capabilities of the **Hatcher Autopilots**.
  - **Performance Enhancements:** Continuously improve the speed and efficiency of the core IDE.

**Track 2: The EGG Platform**

- **Mission:** Provide a unified platform for building mission-critical software, allowing teams to choose the optimal configuration for their needs.

- **Roadmap:**
  - **Teams Tier (v1.0.0):** Introduce our first paid feature: Private Playbook Marketplaces. This allows teams to codify and share the custom flight plans for their internal **Autopilots.**
  - **Enterprise Tier (v1.1.0):** Launch Hatcher EGGs (Enforced Governance Guardrails) Platform, featuring:
    - **EGG "Compatibility":** The solution for large-scale enterprise deployment where 100% visual and functional consistency is the **highest priority.** This configuration leverages **Tauri with an embedded CEF (Chromium) engine.**
    - **EGG "Performance":** The solution for environments where **efficiency, a minimal footprint, and the highest level of security are paramount.** This configuration uses **Tauri's native OS WebView.**
  - **Auditability & Compliance:** Ship advanced **Time Graph** features for compliance officers and introduce robust audit logging.
  - **Hatcher BaaS:** Launch our integrated Backend-as-a-Service to provide a zero-friction, end-to-end deployment solution for Hatcher EGGs.

**Track 3: The Future: Community & Core**

- **Mission:** Fulfill our long-term architectural vision by empowering the community and forging our core in Rust.

- **Roadmap:**
  - **Community-Powered Performance** Actively work with the open-source community to perfect the cross-platform consistency of our EGG "Performance" (Tauri Native) components.
  - **The Path to Rust:** Begin the strategic migration of the **Hatcher IDE** itself from our proven Electron prototype to a next-generation engine forged in Rust.

## Our Guiding Principle

This roadmap reflects our commitment to a deliberate, phased approach. We are balancing foundational stability with ambitious innovation to establish Hatcher as the definitive Constitutional IDE for the AI era.
