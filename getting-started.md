# Getting Started with Hatcher

Welcome, Pioneer.

You've arrived at the foundational stage of a new era in software development. Hatcher is being forged in the open by a community of artisans, and this is your invitation to grab a hammer.

This guide is for developers who want to join us on Day Zero and help shape the future of the Constitutional IDE.

## Project Status & Roadmap

Our vision is a single platform with two distinct configurations. Hereâ€™s where we are today:

### <DocIcon type="constitutional" inline /> Hatcher Generative (In Active Development)

This is the current focus of our core team. The Generative node is the command cockpit for rapid, creative development, where the developer guides the AI with high-level instructions. This is the part of the codebase where new contributors can have the most immediate impact.

### <DocIcon type="building" inline /> Hatcher EGGs (On the Roadmap)

The EGGs (Enforced Governance Guardrails) node is our ultimate goal for mission-critical systems. It represents the "aerospace cleanroom" where every action is 100% deterministic and auditable. **This functionality is not yet implemented** and represents an exciting architectural challenge for the future. We welcome community discussion and ideas on its implementation.

## Why Contribute to Hatcher?

By joining us in this early Alpha phase, you have a unique opportunity to:

- **Shape a Foundational Tool:** Influence the core architecture and direction of a tool that will be used by thousands of developers.

- **Work with a World-Class Stack:** Dive deep into a codebase built with Rust, TypeScript, WebAssembly, and cutting-edge AI principles.

- **Build Your Reputation:** Become a recognized founding contributor in the Hatcher Guild, a community that values craftsmanship and expertise.

- **Solve Interesting Problems:** From building a custom Git engine to designing a visual UI-to-code bridge, the challenges we're tackling are anything but trivial.

## How to Contribute

Ready to become a contributor? The only way to run Hatcher right now is to build it from the source.

### Prerequisites

Make sure your development environment has:

- **Node.js** 22.0.0 or higher
- **pnpm** 10.6.0 or higher
- **Git**

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HatcherDX/dx-engine.git
cd dx-engine

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development mode
pnpm dev
```

This will launch the Hatcher IDE on your local machine, running the latest development build.
