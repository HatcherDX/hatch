# Free for Artisans. Paid for Fleets.

## The Open Core Pact

<div style="padding: 2rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.1) 0%, rgba(118, 75, 162, 0.1) 100%); border-radius: 12px; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; font-size: 1.5rem;">Our Sacred Promise</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
    <strong>The Hatcher IDE for local development will always be free and MIT licensed.</strong><br>
    Forever. No asterisks. No "free tier" that expires. No features locked behind paywalls.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0;">
    If you're a solo developer, a student, an open source contributor, or just someone who wants to command Autopilots on your own machine ‚Äî Hatcher is yours. Free. Forever.
  </p>
</div>

## Why Free?

### We Believe in Amplification for All

The magic prompt isn't magic ‚Äî it's inequality. Those with access to the right prompts, the right tools, the right knowledge get 10x productivity. Everyone else gets left behind.

By making Hatcher free for individual use, we ensure that **every developer** ‚Äî regardless of geography, economy, or employer ‚Äî can access the power of autonomous development.

### The Best Features Come from the Community

Open source isn't charity ‚Äî it's strategy. The most innovative Playbooks, the most creative Autopilots, the most elegant patterns will come from the global community of Artisans using Hatcher every day.

Your contributions make Hatcher better for everyone. Our business model ensures we can keep building it.

## The Commercial Vision

### Sustainability Through Scale

While individual Artisans forge in solitude, teams and enterprises need more:

</div>

</div>

## The Math of Freedom

Here's our radical transparency:

- **1 million free users** using Hatcher locally = A revolution in how software is built
- **10,000 team subscribers** at $75/month average = $9M ARR to fund development
- **100 enterprise customers** at $100K/year average = $10M ARR for sustainability

We don't need to monetize individuals to build a great business. We need to build something so powerful that teams and enterprises can't imagine working without it.

## Our Commitment

We're not building a company that monetizes developers. We're building a company that **empowers** developers and monetizes the **value multiplication** that happens when teams and enterprises adopt autonomous development.

**Free for Artisans. Paid for Fleets.**

This is our pact. This is our path.
