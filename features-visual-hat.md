title: The Visual HAT - Screenshot to System
description: Transform any visual input into functional code. From mockups to screenshots to whiteboard drawings — if you can see it, the Visual HAT can build it.

# <DocIcon type="visual" inline /> The Visual HAT

> **Pillar Connection:** The Visual HAT embodies our philosophy of ["From Textual Guesswork to Visual Intent"](/philosophy#pillar-1-from-textual-guesswork-to-visual-intent), implementing the [Visual-to-Code Bridge](/visual-to-code) to eliminate ambiguity in AI communication.

## Screenshot to System

The Visual HAT is the bridge between vision and implementation. Point it at anything visual — a screenshot, a mockup, a competitor's site, even a napkin sketch — and watch it transform into functional, production-ready code.

### The End of "Make It Look Like This"

No more:

- Pixel-pushing to match designs
- "Can you move it 2px left?"
- Explaining the same layout 10 times
- Rebuilding what already exists elsewhere

Just show the Visual HAT what you want. It builds it. Perfectly.

## How It Works

### 1. Capture

Point at anything:

- Screenshots of existing apps
- Figma/Sketch designs
- Competitor websites
- Hand-drawn wireframes
- Even photos of whiteboards

### 2. Analyze

The Visual HAT understands:

- Layout structure and hierarchy
- Component patterns
- Interaction models
- Design system rules
- Responsive behavior

### 3. Generate

Get production-ready code:

- Semantic HTML/JSX
- Styled with your framework
- Responsive by default
- Accessibility included
- Animations inferred

## Real-World Magic

### Scenario 1: Competitive Parity

**Challenge**: "Make our dashboard look like Stripe's but with our brand"

**Visual HAT Solution**:

1. Screenshot Stripe's dashboard
2. HAT extracts layout patterns
3. Applies your design system
4. Generates your tech stack code
5. Maintains your component library

**Result**: Stripe-quality UI in hours, not months.

### Scenario 2: Design-to-Code Pipeline

**Challenge**: Designer updates Figma, developers scramble to implement.

**Visual HAT Solution**:

```yaml
pipeline: figma-sync
trigger: design-updated
actions:
  - extract: components-changed
  - generate: react-components
  - test: visual-regression
  - pr: auto-create
```

**Result**: Designs become code automatically. Designers see their exact vision. Developers focus on logic.

### Scenario 3: Legacy UI Modernization

**Challenge**: Ancient jQuery UI needs to become modern React.

**Visual HAT Solution**:

1. Screenshot existing UI
2. HAT identifies UI patterns
3. Maps to modern components
4. Generates React equivalent
5. Preserves exact functionality

**Result**: Pixel-perfect modernization without specifications.

## Advanced Capabilities

### Interaction Detection

The Visual HAT doesn't just see static layouts:

- **Hover States**: Infers from design variations
- **Animations**: Detects motion patterns
- **Micro-interactions**: Reproduces subtle behaviors
- **State Changes**: Understands UI flows

### Design System Integration

```yaml
visual-config:
  design-system: 'our-company-ds'
  component-mapping:
    - detected: 'button-primary'
      use: "Button variant='primary'"
    - detected: 'card-layout'
      use: 'Card elevation={2}'
  style-overrides:
    - colors: 'use-brand-palette'
    - spacing: 'use-8px-grid'
```

### Multi-Platform Generation

One screenshot, multiple outputs:

- **Web**: React, Vue, Angular
- **Mobile**: React Native, Flutter
- **Desktop**: Electron, Tauri
- **Email**: MJML templates
- **Print**: PDF layouts

## Integration with Other HATs

The Visual HAT amplifies everything:

- **With Code HAT**: Visual → Functional instantly
- **With Gen HAT**: Enhance captured designs
- **With Time Graph HAT**: Track visual evolution

## Command Examples

```bash
# Convert screenshot to code
hatcher visual convert --input screenshot.png --output react

# Sync Figma to codebase
hatcher visual sync --figma-url "..." --target "./src/components"

# Extract design system
hatcher visual extract-system --source "competitor.com" --output "ds.yaml"

# Generate responsive variants
hatcher visual responsive --input "desktop.png" --breakpoints "mobile,tablet"
```

## The Visual Workflow Revolution

### Before Visual HAT

1. Designer creates mockup (2 days)
2. Developer interprets design (1 day)
3. Back-and-forth on details (2 days)
4. Responsive adaptations (1 day)
5. Accessibility additions (1 day)
6. Final polish (1 day)

**Total: 8 days**

### With Visual HAT

1. Designer creates mockup (2 days)
2. Visual HAT generates code (5 minutes)
3. Developer adds logic (2 hours)

**Total: 2.5 days**

## Pattern Recognition Library

The Visual HAT learns from every conversion:

- **Common Patterns**: Headers, footers, navigation
- **Industry Standards**: E-commerce, SaaS, content sites
- **Cultural Variations**: RTL layouts, Asian typography
- **Accessibility Patterns**: Screen reader optimizations

## The Visual Liberation

The Visual HAT isn't about skipping design — it's about **perfect implementation**:

- No more implementation drift
- No more "almost like the mockup"
- No more responsive guesswork
- No more accessibility afterthoughts

Designers design. The Visual HAT implements. Perfectly.
