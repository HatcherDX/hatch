# The Core HATs: Hatcher Adaptive Tools

HATs (Hatcher Adaptive Tools) are specialized development interfaces that adapt to your specific task and thinking style. Like switching between different tools in a Swiss Army knife, each HAT provides the perfect interface for its domain.

## Why HATs?

Traditional IDEs force you into a single interface for all tasks. But different problems require different tools and perspectives:

- **Visual tasks** need visual tools
- **Code generation** needs conversational interfaces
- **Debugging** needs time-travel capabilities
- **Architecture** needs structural views

HATs solve this by providing specialized interfaces that you can switch between seamlessly, all while maintaining context and consistency.

## The Four Core HATs

### <DocIcon type="visual" inline /> [The Visual HAT](/features-visual-hat)

**For designers who code and coders who design**

The Visual HAT bridges the gap between design and implementation. Click on any UI element to instantly jump to its code. Drag to reposition. Resize with handles. Your visual changes translate directly to code changes.

- Direct visual manipulation of components
- Instant code navigation from UI elements
- Real-time preview of changes
- Design system integration

### <DocIcon type="gen" inline /> [The Gen HAT](/features-gen-hat)

**For AI-powered code generation with control**

The Gen HAT is your conversational coding partner. Describe what you want, and watch as AI generates code that follows your Playbooks and standards. But unlike other AI tools, you maintain complete control over what gets accepted.

- Natural language to code generation
- Playbook-aware AI suggestions
- Diff preview before applying changes
- Incremental refinement through conversation

### <DocIcon type="code" inline /> [The Code HAT](/features-code-hat)

**For when you need to write code directly**

Sometimes you need the precision of direct code manipulation. The Code HAT provides a supercharged coding environment with all of Hatcher's intelligence features available as assists rather than automation.

- Traditional code editing with AI assists
- Intelligent autocomplete based on Playbooks
- Inline documentation and examples
- Refactoring tools with preview

### <DocIcon type="time-graph" inline /> [The Time Graph HAT](/features-time-graph-hat)

**For debugging through time and space**

The Time Graph HAT transforms debugging from archaeology to time travel. Navigate through your code's execution history, see how state changed over time, and understand exactly what happened and why.

- Visual execution timeline
- State snapshots at every point
- Cause-and-effect tracking
- Performance profiling

## Seamless Switching

The power of HATs comes from their integration. You can:

1. **Start in Visual HAT** to position a button
2. **Switch to Gen HAT** to add functionality with AI
3. **Jump to Code HAT** to fine-tune the implementation
4. **Use Time Graph HAT** to debug any issues

All while maintaining context and without losing your work.

## Context Preservation

When you switch HATs, Hatcher preserves:

- Your current file and position
- Selected components and elements
- Undo/redo history
- AI conversation context
- Debugging breakpoints

## Extensible Architecture

The HAT system is designed to be extended. Future HATs might include:

- **Data HAT**: Visual database design and queries
- **API HAT**: Request builder and testing
- **Deploy HAT**: Infrastructure as visual diagrams
- **Team HAT**: Collaborative coding interfaces

## The Right Tool for the Right Job

HATs embody Hatcher's philosophy of Controlled Amplification. Instead of forcing you to adapt to the tool, the tool adapts to your task. Each HAT amplifies your abilities in its domain while maintaining the control and precision you need as a professional developer.
